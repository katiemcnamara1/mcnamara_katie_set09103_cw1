 Les Miserables, affectionally known as Les Mis, is the stage adaptation of Victor Hugo's 1862 novel of the same name. The sung-through musical was originally written in French by Claude-Michel Schonberg, Alain Boubil and Jean-Marc Natel and staged in 1980. After a short run in Paris, Cameron Mackintosh heard the soundtrack and decided to produce an English-language version for a British audience. Working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Mackintosh's Miserables opened in 1985 with new lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer. The legendary show about ex-convict Jean Valjean and his rival, policeman Javert, received mixed reviews from critics but blew audiences away. The initial two month run at the Barbican Centre was a sell-out, guaranteeing a place on the West End at the Palace Theatre where it ran from 1985 to 2004. It then moved to Queen's Theatre where it still runs today - making it the longest-running musical in the world.

  Les Miserables has had three runs on Broadway - one of which earned it eight Tony Awards - and has toured the world. Les Mis is a cultural phenomenon that can't be avoided. And for good reason. The grand score is often covered, both by artists such as Katherine Jenkins and Susan Boyle - famed for auditioning with "I Dreamed A Dream" on Britain's Got Talent. It was adapted into a film in 2012 which starred Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne and Sacha Baron Cohen. It received eight Academy Award nominations and won three. Les Miserables is a timeless musical which is still thrilling audiences night after night - it's even won the critics over.
